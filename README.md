# Shatterfall-Demo
The free demo for our Indie game "Shatterfall"

Shatterfall is a fast paced Sci-Fi shooter game where you, an alien soldier, are trying to escape a parasite infested Earth after an intergalactic war with humans. Can you survive the horrors that have corrupted the last stronghold of humanity, or will you befall to the same, or worse than the humans the once roamed this planet?

If you are reading this and you enjoy this demo, please consider buying our game on Steam when we release it.

It helps us a lot and we really want to be able to start a game development company and buying our game helps us achieve that goal.

Anyways, enjoy the Shatterfall demo!
